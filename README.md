A virtual reality Android application using the Unity 3D game engine, Google VR SDK and C Sharp to create a virtual experience for the user of being in the Navy in the IdeaHack: America's Navy hackathon. The idea was to spread awareness about the various fields the Navy operates in and motivate them to consider the Navy as a career.

Assets used for creating the application have not been added because of their huge size, which was making the project size go above 1 GB, although the app size was under 100 MB.
